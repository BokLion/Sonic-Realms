This is a 360Â° platformer physics engine inspired by the old Sonic the Hedgehog games.

It's a work in progress and doesn't have many examples, though it is documented as thoroughly as possible. A complete product is expected around mid-December, when SAGE starts. For now, just shoot me an e-mail if you need help!

## How to Use
Releases are severely outdated right now as SAGE inches closer. Cloning or downloading the repo at master is recommended.
