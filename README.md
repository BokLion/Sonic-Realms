This is a 360Â° platformer physics engine inspired by the old Sonic the Hedgehog games.

It's a heavy work in progress and doesn't have many features right now... or documentation. A complete product is expected around mid-December, when SAGE starts. For now, just shoot me an e-mail if you need help!
